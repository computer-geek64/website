<span class="bold"><a href="https://github.com/computer-geek64/milesnap">MileSnap</a></span>
Description: MileSnap is an application that allows a user to take a picture of a gas station sign and recieve the fuel type and its corresponding price. Our team created a spatial image post-processing algorithm for high-accuracy data extraction. MileSnap was developed at HackGT 6 and won the PDI Challenge (https://devpost.com/software/hackgt6-g74o8p).

Description: The Accessible Audio Keyboard is a predictive audio keyboard that was developed based on research from a Norwegian university. This keyboard allows people with vision and movement disabilities to communicate efficiently, implementing dual binary inputs to effectively minimize the required movement. This project also leverages predictive word completion for optimal communication speed, using text-to-speech to provide feedback to the user.

Description: Deep Learning for Tropospheric Ozone Predictions was my senior capstone project at Polytech High School. This project used TensorFlow machine learning framework to construct a deep neural network to analyze and predict ground-level ozone levels. This project also leveraged government air quality databases with the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) and SQL-based frameworks in Python. The front-end of this project was constructed using Java Swing.

Description: I worked with university research students at the Optical Science Center for Applied Research (OSCAR) under a NASA research grant during my internship to develop this project. We collectively created an autonomous aerial greenhouse gas data collection module using Arduinos that won first place at a local university's summer research symposium.
